Neural organoids and confocal microscopy have the potential to play an important role in micro-connectome research and understanding neural patterns. In this study, we present \textit{PLayer}, a Plug-and-Play Embedded Neural System, demonstrating the utilization of sparse confocal microscopy layers to interpolate continuous axial resolution. With an embedded system focused on neural network pruning, image scaling, and post-processing methods, \textit{PLayer} achieves performance metrics with an average Structural Similarity Index of 0.9217 and a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 27.75 dB, all within 20 seconds. This represents a significant time-saving of 85.71\% from simplified image processing. By harnessing statistical map estimation in interpolation and incorporating the Vision Transformer-based \textit{Restorer}, \textit{PLayer} ensures 2D layer consistency while mitigating heavy computational dependence. \textit{PLayer} reconstructs 3D neural organoid confocal data continuously with limited computational power, aiming to translate into wide acceptance of fundamental connectomics and pattern-related research with embedded devices.
